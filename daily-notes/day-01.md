# Day 01 – Why I am preparing for a PhD

Many people start preparing for a PhD because they want a degree, a foreign opportunity, or academic prestige.  
I realized that my reason is different — and also more uncertain.

## What I reflected on today
I reflected on why I keep returning to research despite the rejections, confusion, and lack of clear outcomes. I noticed that I am more interested in understanding *why problems exist* and *why solutions fail* than in simply applying existing methods.

## One useful insight for PhD aspirants
Preparing for a PhD is less about having everything figured out and more about being comfortable with not knowing. Curiosity matters more than confidence at this stage.

## One challenge I noticed
It is difficult to justify pursuing a research path when progress is slow, feedback is limited, and results are not immediately visible.

## One question I am thinking about
How can someone distinguish between genuine research interest and temporary motivation when the journey involves long periods of uncertainty?
